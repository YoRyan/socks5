# socks5

A really simple SOCKS 5 server with some cool features:

* Written in Python 3 -- no external dependencies
* Fits in one file -- no installation required
* Pick an address and port
* IPv6 support
* Can select a source address to proxy connections from (for multihomed systems,
  or to force IPv4/IPv6 only)
